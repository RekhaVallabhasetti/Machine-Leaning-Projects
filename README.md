K means Neighbours:
The k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple and versatile supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's based on the idea that similar data points tend to have similar labels (in the case of classification) or similar numeric values (in the case of regression).

Decision Tree Classifier:
A Decision Tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like structure where an internal node represents a feature or attribute, a branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome or a decision.
